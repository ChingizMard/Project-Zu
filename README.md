This file uses manifests to cache the information on the device. Originally was used in order to "send" goodmorning messages to a girl when she was cmaping and did not have
any outside connection. Basicaly all of the messages were cached on the phone and messages were shown once per day.

Actual messages were deleted intentially.

INCLUDE jQUERY BEFORE USE!
