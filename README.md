This file uses manifests to cache the information on the device. Originally was used in order to "send" good-morning messages to a girl when she was camping and did not have any outside connection. Basically all of the messages were cached on the phone and then were shown once per day.

Actual messages were deleted intentionally.

INCLUDE JQUERY BEFORE USE!
